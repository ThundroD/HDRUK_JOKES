# HDRUK_Jokes

### Simple CRUD MERN Stack App to help and Admin add and delete jobs. Instead of on a file the jokes are now stored on a MongoDB database are pulled into an application. Unfortunately, I spent a lot of time on trying to make admin prevelegies, as seen with some of my dependencies in the package.json file. However, being unsuccessful I ran out of time to list random jokes on a home page.

### The app was built with MongoDB, Express, React, Redux, Mongoose and Node.JS

### To run the app first ```npm i``` on both the frontend and back end.
### After to run both backend and front end you can run ```npm run dev```
### To just run front ```npm run client```
### Just run back ```npm run server```
